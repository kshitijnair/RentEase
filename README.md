# RentEase
RentEase is a mobile application for finding and listing rental homes, apartments, or rooms. With RentEase, tenants can search for rental properties based on their preferences, location, and budget. Lessors can list their properties, manage inquiries, and communicate with potential tenants all in one place.

The app offers a unique feature where tenants can read reviews from previous tenants and current viewing renters about the place they are interested in. This authentic communication is something that other rental apps do not provide. Users can also add their comments about the place, with additional or missing information that shows up anonymously on the listing.
